			<p> <em>Kristin Moser</em>, here! Nice to meet ya (/^â–½^)/. Currently a rising senior at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, located in Downtown Brooklyn. Majoring in the finest of sciences, <em>computer science</em>. Expecting to graduate early in Fall 2017. This summer I will be joining Meetup as a UI Engineering Intern.</p>
			<p> Coding has been a huge part of my life since I first began in freshman year of college. I love the <em>versatility</em> and <em>creativity</em> that comes along with every part of programming. I'm especially interested in <em>full-stack engineering</em> as I love the design and movement of applications, but also enjoy the behind the scenes development.</p>
			<p>  </p>
			<p>I have many other loves including: knitting, baking, embroidery, watercolor, garderning, photography, and petting dogs</em>. </p>

			<p>In this game, there is a central cube. every side of the cube is a different color. You can only see 3 sides of the cube at once.
			Colored spheres matching with one side of the cube moves from either of the four directions (up, down, right, left) towards the cube. The player
			must rotate the cube to the colored side that corresponds with the color of the sphere. Players accumulate points by correctly matching the side with the sphere
			before the sphere hits the cube.</p>
