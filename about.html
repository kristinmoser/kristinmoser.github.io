<h2>About</h2>
<div id = "blurbs">
<p> Hi there! I'm Kristin Moser and this is my website! I am a junior at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, located in Downtown Brooklyn. I'm studying Computer Science.</p>
<p> I started coding during my senior year of high school. There I played around with HTML and CSS in an Intro to Programming class. I didn't think much of it at the time. It wasn't until the summer before college when I started learning Python that I realized that this is something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. So before the term started, I changed my major from Civil Engineering to Computer Science and haven't looked back. </p>
<p> During my first year, I became more familiar with Python and familiar with C++. I also took a course called Intro to Computer Science which has really helped me explore all the aspects of the Computer Science field. Now in my second year, I've participated in my first hackathon and was a part of creating a game! I'm excited to see what new projects and adventures are in my future. </p>
<p>When I'm not studying or doing homework, I can be found tangled in a ball of yarn, trying to finish one of the many knitting projects I've started. In the spring and summer months, I enjoy gardening, hiking, and just generally being outdoors.  </p>
