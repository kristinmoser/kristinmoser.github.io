<h2>about</h2>
<div id = "blurbs">
<p> Hi there! I'm Kristin Moser and this is my website! I am a rising sophmore at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, located in Downtown Brooklyn. I'm studying Computer Science. I'm still currently deciding what to specialize in, but I am interested in web development. </p>
<p> I started "coding" during my senior year of high school. There I played around with HTML and CSS in an Intro to Programming class. I didn't think much of it at the time. It wasn't until the summer before college when I started learning Python that I realized that this is something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. So before the term started, I changed my major from Civil Engineering to Computer Science and do not regret it at all. </p>
<p> During my first year, I have become more familiar with Python and familiar with C++. I also took a course called Intro to Computer Science which has really helped me explore all the aspects of the Computer Science field. Through a series of lectures and assignments, I learned about GitHub, Little Man Computer, Networking, VMs, Security, Artificial Intelligence, Databases, Encoding, Web Design, Theory, and Games. Although only recieving basic knowledge on most of these subjects, it was a great introduction to Computer Science as more than just programming. </p>
